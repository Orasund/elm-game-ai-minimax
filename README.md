### When to use this package

* Implementing a Chess AI.
* You want an AI for a 2 player turn-based game with no randomness and no hidden knowledge (like cards).

### When not to use this package

* Your game is played in real-time.
* Your game has cards.
* Your game has a dice or any other mechanic that introduces randomness.
* You need advanced technics used in Chess AIs.

## Why is no Alpha-Beta Pruning implemented?

Honestly, I struggled implementing a valid implementation.

I decided that its better to publish a simpler version than to publish nothing at all.
